# servlet-practice

### servlet-fundamentals
* Basic annotations for naming and urlpatterns for servlets
* Difference between get and post methods
* Difference between servlet and jsp

### Reading servlet parameters from web.xml
* Write information about servlet parameters in web.xml
* Use getServletContext() helper class to read and parse the information in web.xml
* Use getInitParameters to read its values 
* Note: This method has a scope to all the servlets in the applications, not specific to any servlet



### Issues faced during the project
* How to print values from an enumeration?
* How to provide servlet specific init param in the web.xml?
